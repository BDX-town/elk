# Mangane-elk Monorepo

This repository hosts two essential projects aimed at enhancing the Akkoma ecosystem: a fork of Elk and a fork of Masto.js named Akko.js.

## Overview

### Elk Fork

The Elk fork in this monorepo aims to replace Mangane, an Akkoma client, with a new codebase based on Elk. This fork will leverage Elk's modern and nimble architecture to provide a more efficient and user-friendly experience for Akkoma users.

### Akko.js

Akko.js is a fork of Masto.js, tailored to add Akkoma-specific features. While Masto.js is a universal API client for Mastodon, Akko.js extends its capabilities to better support Akkoma's unique requirements and functionalities.

## Features

### Elk Fork

- **Modern Architecture**: Built on a modern stack, including Nuxt, Vue, and more.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed to be intuitive and easy to use.

### Akko.js

- **Universal**: Works in Node.js, browsers, and Deno.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal runtime codes, less than 6kB minified and gzipped.
- **TypeScript**: Written in TypeScript with full type definitions.
- **Akkoma-Specific**: Enhanced with features tailored for Akkoma.
