# Akko.js

## Universal Akkoma API client for JavaScript


This project is a fork of [Masto.js](https://github.com/neet/masto.js/) aiming to adapt the project to [Akkoma](https://akkoma.dev)

## Features

- ðŸŒŽ **Universal:** Works in Node.js, browsers, and Deno
- ðŸ“¦ **Lightweight:** Less runtime codes, [6kB+ minified and gzipped](https://bundlephobia.com/package/akko)
- ðŸ“š **TypeScript:** Written in TypeScript, and provides type definitions
- ðŸ§ª **Tested:** 100% test coverage using a real Mastodon server
- ðŸ¤“ **Maintained:** Actively maintained by a Fediverse lover [since 2018](https://github.com/neet/akko.js/releases/tag/1.0.0)

## Quick Start

In this quick start, we'll look at how to create a simple Mastodon bot that publishes a post using _Akko.js_.

First, you must install _Node.js_ and _npm_ in your environment. Follow [the npm official guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for the setup, and proceed to the next step. Alternatively, you can use _yarn_, _pnpm_, or other package managers to install Akko.js.

The minimal required version of dependencies is as follows:

- **Node.js**: `>= 18.x`
- **npm**: `>= 9.x`
- **TypeScript** (optional peer dependency): `>= 5.0.0`

If you successfully installed _Node.js_ and _npm_, create your first _Akko.js_ project with the following command. Assume you're using a POSIX-compatible operating system.

Create a directory and initialise your project.

```sh
npm init --yes
npm pkg set type=module
```

Make sure a `package.json` file is created in your project directory. Then install Akko.js using _npm_

```
npm install akko
```

Now you successfully initialised your project for developing a Mastodon bot. Next, you need to create an application to obtain an _[access token](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/client/authorized/)_ required to access your account.

Go to your settings page, open **Development**, and click the **New Application** button to obtain your personal access token.

You need to fill out _Application name_, but rest of the fields can be left as defaults. What you need to select for _Scopes_ is depending on your bot's ability, but you can access most of the functionality by granting `read` and `write`. See [OAuth Scopes](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/oauth-scopes/) documentation for further information.

Once you have created an application, save **Your access token** securely. This string is required to access your account through Akko.js.

Then you're almost there! Create a file named `index.js` inside your project directory and add the following code. This is an example which will post a status from your account.

```ts
import { createRestAPIClient } from "akko";

const akko = createRestAPIClient({
  url: process.env.URL,
  accessToken: process.env.TOKEN,
});

const status = await akko.v1.statuses.create({
  status: "Hello from #mastojs!",
});

console.log(status.url);
```

Finally, run the program with the following command. Replace `{URL}` with your instance's URL such as `https://bdx.town`, and `{TOKEN}` to your access token that you obtained in the previous section.

```
URL={URL} TOKEN={TOKEN} node ./index.js
```

Enjoy your Akkoma development with Akko.js!
