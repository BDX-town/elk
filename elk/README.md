## ‚ö†Ô∏è Elk is in Alpha

It is already quite usable, but it isn't ready for wide adoption yet. We recommend you use it if you would like to help us build it. We appreciate your feedback and contributions. Check out the [Open Issues](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk/issues) and jump in the action. Join the [Elk discord server](https://chat.elk.zone) to chat with us and learn more about the project.

## Deployment

### Official Deployment

Our team maintains a deployment at:

- üêô Canary: [mangane.bdx.town](https://mangane.bdx.town)

### Self-Host Docker Deployment

In order to host Elk yourself you can use the provided Dockerfile to build a container with elk. Be aware, that Elk only loads properly if the connection is done via SSL/TLS. The Docker container itself does not provide any SSL/TLS handling. You'll have to add this bit yourself.
One could put Elk behind popular reverse proxies with SSL Handling like Traefik, NGINX etc.

> We also provide ready-to-use docker image on this repo's release page. Please look at the `elk.zip` file included in each release.

1. checkout source ```git clone https://github.com/elk-zone/elk.git```
1. got into new source dir: ```cd elk```
1. create local storage directory for settings: ```mkdir elk-storage```
1. adjust permissions of storage dir: ```sudo chown 911:911 ./elk-storage```
1. start container: ```docker-compose up --build -d```

> [!NOTE]
> The provided Dockerfile creates a container which will eventually run Elk as non-root user and create a persistent named Docker volume upon first start (if that volume does not yet exist). This volume is always created with root permission. Failing to change the permissions of ```/elk/data``` inside this volume to UID:GID 911 (as specified for Elk in the Dockerfile) will prevent Elk from storing it's config for user accounts. You either have to fix the permission in the created named volume, or mount a directory with the correct permission to ```/elk/data``` into the container.
